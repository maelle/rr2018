# rr2018

Abstracts I'll submit to the French R conference.

I am on the program committee but obviously I won't review my own submissions :grin:

Both abstracts are inspired by my keynote talk about rOpenSci onboarding at satRday Cape Town. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ3deq52qCk), [slides](http://www.masalmon.eu/satrday_keynote/slides).

## Capturez votre écran depuis R !

This would hopefully be a lightning talk about taking screenshots for slides using `webshot` and `magick`. [Source](webshot_lightning.Rmd), [Pdf](webshot_lightning.pdf).

## Notre système de revue de paquets en revue : présenter et analyser rOpenSci onboarding

This would hopefully be a regular talk about rOpenSci onboarding (topical topic ahah) and about analyzing git and GitHub data with R (technical topic). [Source](git_github_regular.Rmd), [Pdf](git_github_regular.pdf).

/* This CSS is from the drposter template for pandoc/rmarkdown and is released into the public domain (CC0).  Have fun! */

/* CSS styles are organized into separate stylesheets for clarity. */
/* In general, that's suboptimal for page load times (at least without minification), but maintainability is far more important for a static poster. */
/* The local custom.css is a good way to override the defaults from drposter_files/, to ensure decoupling of your changes from the package. */
/* See examples.css for a few examples on how to effectively modify these styles in your custom CSS */
